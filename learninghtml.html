    <h1>Learning Website</h1>
    <p> Hi everyone, I'm Hector, a 19 year old college student. I'm studying the computer engineering major at ULE, Spain.
        I'm building this website because I want to learn how to do it, I'm sure I'm going to enjoy this a lot. And actually,
        this will actually help me to keep practising my english, because since i moved back from Ireland, I obviously haven't used it much.
    </p>

    <p> Obviously this is gonna take sometime, becasue I want to make sure I have as much as knowledge as I can, but this
        I really hope my career gets better and better. Can't wait!!! I have passed 2 out of the 5 subjects this semester,
        it's not as good as I planned it to be, but it's how college works I guess, not all the work is recompensated.Ç
