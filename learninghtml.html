            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Hi everyone, I'm Hector, a 19-year-old college student. I'm studying Computer Engineering at ULE, Spain.
            </p>
            <p>I'm building this website to learn how to do it. I'm sure I'm going to enjoy this a lot. And actually,
                this will help me keep practicing my English, because since I moved back from Ireland, I obviously
                haven't used it much.</p>
            <p>Obviously this is gonna take some time, because I want to make sure I have as much knowledge as I can. I
                really hope my career gets better and better. Can't wait!!! I have passed 2 out of the 5 subjects this
                semester. It's not as good as I planned, but it's how college works I guess not all the work is
                recompensated.</p>
            <p>One of the things I like the most is football, my passion for this sport started when I was seven or
                eight years old. I support Athletic Club of Bilbao since I started watching football. My childhood idol
                was Aritz Aduriz, Athletic's striker by that time. He became my idol because he was so good, happily
                rembering how he scored four gols against Barça in the Spanish Super Cup.</p>
            <p>Sorry if the web is to basic for now, I'm working on updates but I have an exam left and for the moment
                my focus is to pass it.</p>
